# Deloitte_Practicum_Project

This project prioritized fracking sites for an offshore gas company, which
has limited funding. The prioritization goal is based upon 3 criterias - economic,
geospatial, and media sentiment. Each of the criterias includes several sub
criterias as well. In this analysis the biggest challenge was analyzing qualitative
data, and in order to do so, we utilized the Analytical Hierarchy Process, which
helped us find the best results that meet our goal. After applying the methods
to analyze multiple drilling sites in Colorado, 18 fracking sites are successfully
selected and prioritized. The methodology can be applied to other states and
countries to prioritize fracking sites. It is important to note that the framework
used for this project is modifiable based on clients’ needs; the prioritization
criterias explained above were chosen specific to our client’s needs.
